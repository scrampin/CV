## Skills

#### Versatility

I take real pride in my ability to turn my hand to a number of diffrerent roles, and I believe that this skill is a manifestation of dedication, attention to detail, and the ability to cultivate an ambitious vision for the project at hand. When managing a project I ensure that if there is a detail missed in any aspect, that I am equipped to put the work in to fix it myself, ensuring output that is consistently high in quality and complete.

When developing the website for Friandiz and KO, I was undeterred by a lack of immediate resources, and ensured that the initial draft of the site had copy that was high quality and a design that was professional and brand-appropriate. This led to a prompt launch, and usage/revenue of xyz

Whilst working as a technology consultant, I took on an independent project for a department of the company consisting of 500 people. I developed an excel macro that allowed managers to send congratulatory emails automatically to members of their team whose anniversaries were coming up. This was an important breakthrough in their community management, and achieved company-wide recognition.

#### Strategy

I have consistently held positions that have allowed me to create both long and mid-term strategic plans. In my position as lead tester for an LNG trader, I planned and delivered a series of testing cycles for newly developed treasury software over 9 months.

In my role as Director of Communications at Giving What We Can, I managed a  managing a website redesign that lasted for nine months. This involved communicating with and coordinating the roles of graphic designers, developers and copywriters, as well as designing the vision and strategy for the website. Once implemented, signup rates to the blog and newsletters increased by 20%.

I wrote the comminications strategy for the charity for yearly periods. This involved developing and delivering on KPI's for the charity's publicity and press. Most notably, the efforts of my team drove an increase in membership of over 150%, from 310 to 800. The monthly average growth was 28 members per month; twice as many as the 14 initially planned.
