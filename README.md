## Steph Crampin

I am a Full Stack Junior Developer, with a fondness for the methodology and structure inherent in implementing the principles of Object Oriented Design. I love the combination of creativity and analytical thinking brought by these techniques, and strive to write code that is readable, clean and elegant.

After studying Maths and Philosophy at Oxford I led a website redesign of a fast-growing charitable startup over nine months. Subsequently I worked for two years as a technology consultant, planning and delivering Quality Assurance in the treasury departments of major commodity traders. I moved fully into the tech spere when completing Makers Academy; a 16 week software development bootcamp.

I am keen to adopt a role where I am aware of and involved in the strategy of my current project. Three years of working closely with the deployment of new technologies has taught me that the quality and integrity of project plans often hinges on an intimate connection between technologists and strategists. I look forward to playing my part in both the direction and the implementation of my endeavours.

**Tech skills**: Ruby, Sinatra, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PostgreSQL, Drupal, OpenLink, Rspec, Jasmine


## Skills

#### Excellent communicator

I have been interviewd multiple times for the BBC and the New York Times as part of my work as a charity's Comminications Director. When working as a technology consultant, I frequently presented my work to clients. This was to ensure support of the methods I used, and confidence in my results. I also managed aspects of internal communication, such as editing and distributing the CSR newsletter, and running the selection and distribution of the companyâ€™s core value awards. Since starting Makers, I have been [running a blog](https://www.steph-island.co.uk/) to document my experience.

#### Fast learner

Completing a course at Makers Academy has required learning skills such as Postgresql in one week, and Javascript in three days, with the intention of using these technologies to build fully functioning apps in a number of weeks. In order to solidify and supplement my understanding, I have been running regular sessions to discuss key sections of textbooks on Object Oriented Design and Clean Code with fellow students. I have had the time of my life taking in so much knowledge so quickly, and I can't wait to continue this journey as a developer.

#### Motivated problem solver

Whilst at Sapient Global Markets, I took on an independent tech project for a small and recently acquired department of the company which had not yet fully integrated. I developed a VBA-based excel macro that allowed managers to send congratulatory emails automatically to members of their team whose anniversaries were coming up. This was an important breakthrough in their community management, and achieved company-wide recognition.

#### Strategic planner

As Director of Communications at Giving What We Can, I managed a website redesign, which involved coordinating the roles of graphic designers, developers and copywriters, as well as designing the vision and goals for the website. I wrote the Communications Strategy for the charity for yearly periods, which involved developing and delivering on KPI's for publicity and press. Over the course of my time there, this contributed to an increase in community membership of [over 150%](http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/dashboard).

#### Logical thinker

One of the key strengths I have drawn on as part of completing Makers Academy is my abiltity to analyse problems, and construct a logical solution. I have a longstanding history of excelling at logic and problem solving, spanning back to my degree, where I consistently achieved first class results in pure mathematics. My appreciation for programming and structuring software has been fostered and strengthened by my love of analysing and solving problems.
